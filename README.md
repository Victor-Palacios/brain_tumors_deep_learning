# Detecting Brain Tumor Biomarkers with Deep Learning

----
Project Description
----

This repository is about using deep learning to detect tumors in the brain.
This is repo is for a kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-miccai-brain-tumor-radiogenomic-classification

----
Importance
----

"Currently, genetic analysis of cancer requires surgery to extract a tissue sample. Then it can take several weeks to determine the genetic characterization of the tumor. Depending upon the results and type of initial therapy chosen, a subsequent surgery may be necessary. If an accurate method to predict the genetics of the cancer through imaging (i.e., radiogenomics) alone could be developed, this would potentially minimize the number of surgeries and refine the type of therapy required."

Outcome
----

1. A deep learning model to detect the brain tumor biomarker MGMT.
